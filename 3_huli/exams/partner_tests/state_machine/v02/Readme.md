# Tamas Kamaras - Green Fox Academy exam
## **Simplified state machine**

Dear Visitor,

Thank you for visiting this page. It is intending to display my exam work from Green Fox Academy - DevOps team.

Among the project files you can find my solution in <index.js>, but I went a little bit further and I created a **full web application** based on this test.\
First I created unittests in <test.js> to see weather the functions are working properly then I displayed the states and the transitions interactively in an html page with a little css styling.

After all I deployed the application in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** so you can check out the actual working application on the fly via the url below:
